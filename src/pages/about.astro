                    <h2>Things I'm Into</h2>
                    <ul class="spaced-list">
                        <li><strong>Video Games</strong> - I like playing them, talking about them, keeping up with the industry, everything. I'm currently trying to learn more about game development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Language Learning</strong> - I love digging into the unique quirks of different languages, and while I can't really communicate well in any language outside of English (for now), I've dabbled with the basics of a few others here and there:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Farsi / Persion (Dari)</strong> - <em>Technically</em> my first language, but my speaking abilities have completely atrophied as an adult. It might be time to try and pick it back up.</li>
                                <li><strong>Japanese</strong> - Studied the language for about one year at university.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arabic</strong> - I studied the basics for 2 years at university.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spanish</strong> - Technically studied this langauge for 3 years in High School, but almost none of it stuck. I'd love to learn it to fluency someday.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Drawing</strong> - I always liked to draw and doodle as a kid, but never really pursued it seriously. As an adult, <a href="/art">I've been trying to get back into it.</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Music</strong> - I mainly got into music through video game soundtracks and I'm currently trying to learn both Guitar and Piano. I've also started to try my hand at writing (and recording) some music, so check that out on my <a href="/music">music page.</a></li>
                        <li><strong>Programming/Development</strong> - My current fascinations are both Web and Game Development.</li>
