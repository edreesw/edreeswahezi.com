                        <li><strong>Video Games</strong> - I like playing them when I have time, talking about them, keeping up with the industry, everything. I'm currently trying to learn more about game development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Language Learning</strong> - I'm unfortunately only fluent in English, but I've dabbled with the basics of a few other languages here and there and keep telling myself I'll go back to studying them eventually:</li>

                        <li><strong>Whittling</strong> - I wanted a hobby where I could work with my hands, so I bought a whittling knife and some wood blocks. Haven't cut myself yet.</li>
