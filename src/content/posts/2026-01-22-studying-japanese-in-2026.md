This is it, after over a decade of on and off study I'm fully committing to learning Japanese this year. No, seriously, for real this time. Here's how I'm going to be approaching it: 

## Methodology

Most people seem to over complicate language learning, but I'm convinced it's actually pretty simple (just not necessarily easy). I'll mostly be focusing on grammar study through (university level) textbooks, lots of input through written works and media like videos or podcasts, and both written and spoken output (ideally with other people).

I've found that a lot of online sources tend to try and focus primarily or exclusively on just one aspect of language, which always seemed really misguided to me. Neglecting either grammar study, input, or output feels like intentionally handicapping yourself, and a lot of the people pushing for those methods just seem like they're trying to sell you something (especially those people who try to downplay grammar). Also, I feel like anyone telling you some variation of "just learn like a baby would" is conveniently forgetting that it takes a baby over a decade to work up to an adult speaking level, and even then they're still expected to take grammar courses in school. You're an adult with an adult brain and understanding of language, so use that to your advantage. 

In my mind it's best to just dive into all aspects of a language using a grammar textbook as your primary guide to give you some structure, and fill in whatever gaps you run into as you notice them during input/output practice and general language immersion. Basically, just study the language, listen to the language, and use the language. A lot.

## Tools / Materials / Resources

Books: 
- Tuttle's Elementary Japanese Volumes 1-2. These are college level books I still have from my years worth of college study over a decade ago. I only remember the basics from book 1, so I'll be carefully working through both of them to relearn and master everything I've forgotten and build a strong foundation. 
- Tobira: Gateway to Advanced Japanese + the related kanji and grammar book. Embarrassingly, I purchased these books years ago and just never committed enough time to actually reach intermediate level. This time is going to be different though, I swear. 
- Kodansha Kanji Learners Course. This one will be new for me, as I've never actually tried using a Kanji specific resource before. I had the realization that I'd probably need to dedicated time specifically for Kanji if I wanted to actually start reading native material quickly, since the pace they're introduced in most textbooks is just too slow to actually keep up with the pace you're learning the vocabulary and grammar. 
- Various smaller grammar or cultural books I've accumulated over the years from used bookstores.
- Graded Readers and Japanese children's books from the library.

Apps: 
- Anki, just for basic vocabulary flashcard review using a premade deck. Not a fan of intense Anki use in general, as I've seen people get more into building and reviewing Anki decks than actually learning the language they claim to be studying.
- I find most other language learning apps to be painfully slow wastes of time at best and useless scams at worst, so I'll be avoiding those like the plague (and I suggest you do too).

Listening: 
- Crunchyroll subscription for anime, where I'm planning to rewatch some series I've already seen but this time with the English subtitles off.
- Will likely look for more physical media at the library for exposure to regular day to day Japanese and not just anime-speak.
- Various podcasts and YouTube channels by native speakers.

Output:
- Looking into some foreign language journaling/blogging sites like Journaly and LangCorrect where native speakers can correct my writing.
- Considering using the language tutoring site italki for video calls with native tutors eventually.
- Also considering local language exchange meetups if I can find them and actually work up the courage to attend. 


## Schedule

Consistency is key, and I'm trying to carve out time every day for a bit of Japanese study. Motivation is temporary but discipline is forever, so proper habit building is the real goal here. Ideally, at minimum I'll be doing some grammar study out of a textbook, vocab review, and some kind of kanji memorization/writing practice every day. Then I can supplement that with the various input/output tools mentioned above.

## Goals 

My interest in the Japanese language started with my love of Japanese video games, so eventually I'd like to be able to start engaging with Japanese media of all kinds without the need for subtitles.

As for this year specifically, my goal is to finish going through (and fully mastering) both beginner level textbooks and to firmly enter into intermediate level study with the Tobira books. I'd like to reach a point where I can start reading/working through simple Japanese books and can comfortably hold basic conversations with native speakers to the point where I can survive on a trip to the Japanese countryside.

今年、毎日日本語を勉強するつもりです。頑張ります！
